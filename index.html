            Your smile makes me smile,
            Your laugh makes me laugh.
            Your eyes are enchanting.
            You make my thoughts seem daft.
            Since the day I first laid my eyes on you,
            My curiosity grew and grew.
            During our first conversation, my knees clicked and clacked,
            The butterflies flipped and flapped
            and I knew that there's a lot I 
            wanted to tell you.
            Instead, shall I keep my secrets to myself?
            Shal I take my pride back off the shelf?
            I'm still glad I got to meet you before
            <em>mon dernier d√©part.</em>
